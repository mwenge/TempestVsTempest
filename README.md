# Tempest vs Tempest

In this book I attempt to explore and understand the code and craft of Dave Theurer's 'Tempest' (1980) and Jeff Minter's 'Tempest 2000' (1994).

I'm trying to keep it light and digestible so the book consists of lots of little chapters, each one presenting
a hopefully-tasty morsel from one of the games.
