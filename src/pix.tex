Blitting is the process of writing pixels to the screen. So you need read no further and pass on to the next chapter.

This short extract from the routine that looks after the 'high score' table gives you an idea of how easy using the blitter
can be. All we have to do is point at the position in RAM containing our pixel data (in this case the pixels from \icode{beasty7.cry}
we loaded to \icode{pic5}), tell the blitter the x and y position we want to copy from, the width and height we want to copy, and
the x and y position on the screen we want to copy to.

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%]
  ; Paint the 'Top Guns' graphic
  move.l #pic5,a0    ; file images/beasty7.cry
  move.l #screen3,a1
  move #1,d0         ; x position in pic5
  move #1,d1         ; y position in pic5
  move #223,d2       ; width of block to copy
  move #79,d3        ; height of block to copy 
  move #70,d4        ; x pos of destination
  move #10+8,d5      ; y pos of destination
  jsr CopyBlock
\end{lstlisting}
