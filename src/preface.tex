\chapter*{about this book} 
This is a book about a toy. A toy that was the first of its kind. A kind of toy that has never really caught on,
though maybe its moment lies some way in the future. 

A static picture does the toy no justice, but we will show a few anyway. If you do not know what Psychedelia is, they
might at least give you a flavour of this game that is not a game.
