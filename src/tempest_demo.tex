There is naturally a bit of administrative overhead associated with operating
a game in 'attract mode'. In case you may be wondering, 'attract mode' is when a game cabinet
sits unattended and is attempting to attract customers. The manufacturer can display a colourful title
screen and high score tables, maybe play a tune. But often the most effective way of getting
people to play your game is to show the game being played. This allows the uninitiated to get a sense
of what they're missing out on and also gives them an idea of how to proceed when they
enter their first coin.
Providing this kind of demonstration gameplay means devising some rudimentary intelligence in the game logic that will
mimic the activity of a fairly competent paying customer. Fortunately, in \textit{Tempest}
there are only
two things that a player actually does: move and shoot. This means that our task of 
emulating a player negotiating a level in \textit{Tempest} is simpler
than it might at first appear. We can split it out into two separate concerns, and if we solve 
each one we will have an artificial player that can help bring in some business.

When we get our 'attract mode' up and running we have a small bit of setup to
perform first. The demonstration player is only given one life, and the level they
will play is chosen at random from the first eight.
\begin{lstlisting}
        BIT QSTATUS   ; CHECK FOR ATTRACT MODE..
        IFPL          ; IF IT IS ENABLED THEN..
        LDY I,1       ; LOAD 1 INTO Y REGISTER.
        STY LIVES1    ; AND STORE THAT AS AVAILABLE LIVES.
        LDA RANDOM    ; STORE A RANDOM NUMBER IN ACCUMULATOR.
        AND I,7       ; CLAMP IT TO BETWEEN 0 AND 7.
        ENDIF
        STA X,WAVEN1  ; USE THE RANDOM NUM TO SELECT LEVEL.
        STA CURWAV    ; STORE IT AS THE CURRENT LEVEL TOO.
\end{lstlisting}

With this environment for our player established we can first figure out how to make
him move.
\section*{movement admin}
This one is surprisingly easy. At any given moment we just have to decide whether
the cursor (representing the player) is going to move left or right. The only thing
that should ever affect this decision is whether the movement moves us nearer the same
line as the furthest advanced enemy that we can shoot at.
